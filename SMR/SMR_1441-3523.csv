Based on four types of sporting-event consumers – aesthete, interactive, supporter, and opportunist – we developed the Sporting Event Experience Search Scale (SEES). We conducted an empirical investigation involving two sporting events with both live and mediated types of attendance. Although the first validation step failed to support the four-type structure for the mediated context, the scale appeared to be relevant in a live-attendance context. The SEES scale should therefore allow sporting-event managers to analyse the nature and then the expectations of sport spectators by identifying which sporting event consumption type is dominant. This study consequently proposes four marketing axes corresponding to the four consumption patterns."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of pro-environmental behavior in sport and clubs’ perceived environmental quality on the subjective well-being of sport club members in Germany. Data were collected using an online survey of club members in five team/racket sports (i.e., basketball, football, handball, ice hockey, and tennis; n = 3,038). The outcome of interest is subjective well-being which is measured with the WHO-5 scale. Pro-environmental behavior in sport is captured by the monthly carbon footprint resulting from traveling to training sessions and pro-environmental actions in sport. The results of regression analyses show that pro-environmental actions in sport have a positive effect on members’ well-being. Individuals producing a higher carbon footprint when traveling to training sessions report lower well-being, but the effect is overlapped by pro-environmental actions in sport. Members who perceived their clubs’ environmental quality as higher scored higher on well-being. The number of weekly sport hours had an inverse u-shaped effect on well-being, with the diminishing returns by additional sport hours being offset by pro-environmental actions. Collectively, these findings suggest that protecting the natural environment goes hand in hand with individuals’ well-being and public health goals in the field of mental health."

It is now an integral part of major events and involves an ongoing commitment by Olympic partners who need to find new ways to gain the maximum returns from their investment. Complementary promotions with tourism organisations of the host country represent one such opportunity. There is also growing recognition that service delivery by tourism and hospitality industries may determine the success of many sponsor activities, such as guest hospitality programs. The dynamic nature of Olympic sponsorship is reviewed in the context of the marketing policy framework of the International Olympic Committee. Factors affecting sponsorship at the Sydney 2000 Games are considered with reference to AMP, Ansett Australia, and Visa. It is shown that tourism organisations can play a more active role in attracting sponsors and achieving positive outcomes for the host country."

Drawing on the contextualist approach to organisational change (Pettigrew, 1985) the study was concerned with understanding long-term processes in their context. Analysed were NSOs’ conceptual orientation, structures, resources, capabilities and outcomes. Changing was unveiled through the interplay between three levels of analysis - wider political and economic, sport sector, and organisation-specific. The history of changing unfolded over a 25 years period and followed three stages of crisis of governability (1980-1989), crisis displacement (1989-1997) and identity search (1998-2004). Changing was determined by tensions generated in the previous socialist sport system, the new forces in the NSOs’ context, and by managers’ interpretation of events, and was a discovery process. The three NSOs followed different change patterns of shrinking, insulation and expansion. Two key reasons were responsible for those differences - the institualisation of the broader political and sport sector contexts, and NSOs’ choice to pursue narrow elitism (specialism) or the broader aims of sports development (generalism). The contextualist approach allowed us to appreciate the historical, contextual and processual nature of changing and to discuss the role of managers and various forces in shaping its course and outcomes."

In this article change in a Norwegian football club is studied first by considering the organization as a mixture of rational, natural and open systems, and second, by applying a neo-institutional perspective of translation. Through document analysis, observation and interviews, it was found that change in the sport club's policy is based on the interplay between internal discussions and external influence. When the focal football club should develop a model for development of players, aiming at taking into account both elite orientation and mass participation, the solution was found by mimicking ideas from other organizations in the institutional field. Hence, the article shows how decision-making processes within one sport club's board are related to translations (Campbell, 2004 J.L.CampbellInstitutional change and globalization2004Princeton University PressPrinceton[Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) of ideas in the regional field of similar clubs, more particularly those conceived as successful."

Due to the mainstream appeal of some sports, television audiences and fan-bases can include youth, at-risk and problem gamblers, who may be prompted to gamble, or to increase their gambling, by the direct marketing, alignment of gambling with a ‘healthy’ activity and increased normalisation of gambling. Therefore, sport sponsorship by CGPs promotes a potentially risky behaviour and may exacerbate the public health issue of problem gambling. Regulatory measures have been implemented by governments and private organisations in relation to sport sponsorship by tobacco companies in recognition of the potential harmful impacts of this form of marketing. Subsequently, the involvement of ‘unhealthy products’ including alcohol, junk food and gambling in sport sponsorship has been publicly questioned. This may lead to further regulatory changes that would directly affect the management of sport organisations. Few studies have examined these issues and there is little knowledge of the impacts that sport sponsorship arrangements have on society. Research is needed to inform prudent decision-making about the appropriate regulation of sport sponsorship. This paper reviews the current gambling sport sponsorship landscape and proposes a conceptual framework aimed at facilitating a systematic, interdisciplinary research agenda for examining corporate social responsibility issues pertinent to the sponsorship of sport by CGPs."
