Some football clubs have enacted new roles, such as the Sporting Director, to gain a competitive advantage through effective recruitment of non-playing staff. This qualitative research examines the recruitment strategies of Sporting Directors through the lens of network theory.Research Methods An empirical qualitative study was conducted, involving semi-structured interviews with 25 Sporting Directors in football clubs in England (English Premier League n=12; English Championship, n=13). The qualitative data was thematically analysed.Results and Findings The study contributes novel evidence on recruitment in elite-level football, revealing the theoretical underpinnings and practical nature of this marketplace unique to the football industry. The evidence shows that whilst normally in recruitment weak ties are essential for getting a job, in football, trust and knowing people is the most critical aspect in recruitment, and recruiters rely on strong ties. This homophily creates several unintended implications for business and performance.Conclusions This study responds to a gap in our theoretical and practical understanding of recruitment in elite-level football. The findings raise important questions for those managers and leaders involved in securing talent, as the over-reliance on closed networks may constrain the flow of information and innovation and ultimately limit the potential performance of the organisation. Homophily in recruitment processes may have unintended consequences that require further research, notably for player welfare, inequalities and performance."

We use fixed effects estimations in which we compare the performance of racers when they compete in their home country to performance of the same racers when they compete abroad.Results and findings When using the racer fixed effects model, we find no relationship between competing at home and the likelihood of failing to finish the first run for both genders. However, when using the racer per season fixed effects model, we find that racers have a significantly higher probability of failing to complete the first run when competing abroad.

Through the application of chaos theory, we examine how the trajectory of team development is inherently unpredictable due to the complex nature and uncertainty of initiation rituals.Research methods: The paper draws upon 42 interviews with student athletes from a UK university. The UK context provides a new perspective on initiation activities that are currently dominated by studies in a US setting.Results and findings: From our coding of interview data four themes emerge: Forced assimilation, Dejection, Commitment, and Performance. The results find initiation rituals force sport teams into a period of chaos where outcomes can vary from improved performance to dejection. Thus, sports teams can experience any, or all of the themes present in our findings, and previous group cohesion is an unreliable predictor for successful group development post-initiation.Implications: Theoretically, we further understanding of group development as an unpredictable system due to the nuances and complexities associated with initiations that stimulate periods of chaos. Practically we find administration of bureaucratic control is an ineffective mechanism for constraining initiation activities, and instead it is team leaders and captains who should guide behaviour towards constructive and enjoyable initiations associated with improved commitment and performance of sporting teams."

The results find initiation rituals force sport teams into a period of chaos where outcomes can vary from improved performance to dejection. Thus, sports teams can experience any, or all of the themes present in our findings, and previous group cohesion is an unreliable predictor for successful group development post-initiation.Implications: Theoretically, we further understanding of group development as an unpredictable system due to the nuances and complexities associated with initiations that stimulate periods of chaos. Practically we find administration of bureaucratic control is an ineffective mechanism for constraining initiation activities, and instead it is team leaders and captains who should guide behaviour towards constructive and enjoyable initiations associated with improved commitment and performance of sporting teams."

Own performance is a key driver of satisfaction in sport events, but this variable has received less attention than others in the empirical literature about re-participation intentions, even less so for trail running.Research methods: This paper employed time-series data to analyse re-participation behaviour of trail runners: our dataset includes all participants in the multi-race Transgrancanaria event (Canary Islands, Spain) between 2008 and 2018. A logistic regression (n = 10,170) aims to establish a link between race performance and the propensity to return to the event.Results and findings: Results show that improving own ranking within the same race has positive impacts on re-participation behaviour for both locals and visiting participants. Progressing to a longer race over time boosts loyalty for locals, while finishing in the top ten for a given category also motivates further participation, but only for non-locals.Implications: These findings have implications for the race organiser as they shed light on some key drivers of re-participation that can justify the introduction of measures to incentivise loyalty by taking advantage of the broad choice of events on offer. This can be achieved by offering discounts and other benefits linked to performance or race progression."

This allows assessment of how clubs’ efficiency and effectiveness were affected by the sanctions inflicted on the clubs involved in the scandal.Research methods: Utilising a panel dataset comprising season aggregated match statistics over ten seasons from 2000/01 to 2009/10, this paper estimates a production function for the league and, then, calculates the relative offensive and defensive efficiency and the football effectiveness of 36 teams. To achieve this, DEA models have been used to calculate the frontiers of efficient production.Results and findings: The results partially confirm the evidence of the literature but they also reveal how playing style changed, emphasising the importance of attacking play at the expense of defensive play in Italian Serie A.

In order to alleviate the sports economics ignorance in this area, an entirely new dataset is built up by extracting Comtrade data at the most disaggregated level (6 digits). The dataset covers 41 countries, 36 different sports goods, and 94–96% of global sports goods trade (1994–2004). The country sample is divided into five regional areas: North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA), EU + Switzerland, Eastern Europe, Asia and other emerging countries. A detailed snapshot of global trade in sports goods and its distribution by major areas, countries and products provides first empirical evidence about how much industrialisation in emerging countries and de-industrialisation in developed market economies have affected international specialisation, and indirectly tests multinational companies outsourcing and production relocation strategies in low unit cost countries in the sports goods industry. Then, studying export/import ratios and country's position in the global market, it appears that major trading areas are Asia, Europe and NAFTA. Major exporters are China, Hong Kong, the USA and France, and major importers are the USA, Japan, Germany, France, the UK and Italy. The biggest market shares are in sportswear, anoraks and gymnastic equipment trade. Asia, Eastern Europe and emerging countries have an excess balance in sports goods trade, whereas NAFTA and Europe are in deficit. Three indexes assess a country's comparative advantages and disadvantages and competitiveness, and describe international specialisation. NAFTA and Europe are specialised in equipment-intensive sports goods, while Asia, Eastern Europe and emerging countries are specialised in trite sports goods and some less equipment-intensive sports goods. NAFTA is not competitive in any sport good, Europe is competitive in skis, emerging countries and Eastern Europe in sportswear and anoraks, and Asia in sportswear, anoraks, rackets, balls, skates and gymnastic equipment. Such an international specialisation pattern fits with both assumptions of industrialisation/de-industrialisation and firms outsourcing strategies. A principal component analysis with hierarchical ascendant classification groups trite sports goods as opposed to intensive-equipment sports goods in global trade and shows that production relocation influences international trade specialisation. Major policy implications are that developed economies and multinational companies should continue investing in R&D in order to keep their comparative advantages in equipment-intensive sports goods, while Asian and emerging countries should more tightly supervise working conditions and child labour in their subcontracting producers that work for foreign multinational companies.

Qualitative data were collected via post-event focus groups and 14 interviews with members of Mands’ Mob (Run Melbourne) and the Yarra Babes (MS 24-Hour Mega Swim) who raised funds for two charities: Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation and Multiple Sclerosis Australia.Results and Findings: Five themes were uncovered: (1) team leader communication, (2) team catch-ups, (3) theming, (4) humanising the cause, and (5) bonding at the event. These themes demonstrate that fundraising teams bolster the experience throughout, assist with training, and facilitate social interaction throughout the event among team members.Implications: The themes demonstrate how successful fundraising teams create social impacts that might be leveraged by organisers. There is scope to broaden efforts to complement the work of team leaders in order to inspire participants through personal narratives and distinguish teams through a visual identity and image."

Namely: (i) the promotion of the ‘active citizen’ through social investment strategies that have children and young people as their principal target; and (ii) a ‘no compromise’ approach to winning (Olympic) medals and trophies on the international stage. In utilizing the theoretical perspectives of ‘policy as discourse’ and ‘storylines’, the analysis thus interrogates, and goes some way towards answering, questions raised in the literature regarding the ‘demise’ of Sport for All related programmes and activities. The conclusions consider some of the potential ramifications of this sharpened twofold policy focus for sport policymakers, management professionals and practitioners alike. "

This study investigated how access to sports infrastructure near workplaces is related to the sports participation of working adults, compared with access to sports infrastructure near their homes.Research methods This study used data from a quantitative household survey conducted in 2017. The sample comprised 4006 individuals (including 2147 working adults) aged ≥15 years, representing the entire adult population of Russia. Logistic regression models were performed to estimate the role of infrastructure and individual characteristics in sports participation.Results and findings Only a quarter of Russian adults were regularly involved in sports. The sports participation of Russian adults was attributed to their individual characteristics (gender, age, education, health, and family characteristics) and access to sports infrastructure located near their homes and workplaces. For working adults, access to sports infrastructure near their workplaces was associated with a 12 percentage points increase in the probability of sport participation compared with an 8 percentage points increase associated with access to sports infrastructure near their homes.Implications There is a need to improve working adults’ access to sport facilities. Developing sports infrastructure close to workplaces may have an even stronger potential effect on sports participation among working adults, than investing in infrastructures close to their homes. It can result in additional benefits for workers, employers, and sports providers."

The study contributes to the research field by showing how sport organizations are the basis of the community, locally and nationally.Research methods: Interviews were conducted with seven board members representing five Sámi sport clubs in four municipalities. The sport clubs were all members of the Sámi sport organization, and located in core Sámi areas where Sámi language and culture is manifested in everyday life. Sámi are the indigenous peoples of the northern Norway, Sweden, Finland and north-west Russia.Results and findings: For sport club representatives, Sámi sport refers to specific activities associated with Sámi husbandry heritage, and to the Sámi sport organization.

The study contributes to the research field by showing how sport organizations are the basis of the community, locally and nationally.Research methods: Interviews were conducted with seven board members representing five Sámi sport clubs in four municipalities. The sport clubs were all members of the Sámi sport organization, and located in core Sámi areas where Sámi language and culture is manifested in everyday life. Sámi are the indigenous peoples of the northern Norway, Sweden, Finland and north-west Russia.Results and findings: For sport club representatives, Sámi sport refers to specific activities associated with Sámi husbandry heritage, and to the Sámi sport organization.

I estimate the average treatment effect of the kick-off time by using the distance-weighted radius matching approach with bias adjustment.Results and Findings: There is less attendance as a share of the capacity of the stadiums in games that kick off at 21:05 CET compared to games that start at 19:00 CET. In addition, in games that begin later (21:05) a team with a lower UEFA ranking has a significantly lower home advantage compared to games that begin earlier (19:00).Implications: The results of this study suggest that a lower ranked team that competes three times at home at 21:05 CET loses on average about 270,000 Euros from lower revenue from tickets and UEFA prizes. Additionally, a lower number of points reduces the chances of qualifying for the next round of competition, which is a much larger loss of at least 800,000 Euros, not counting all other revenue from tickets and advertising in more advanced stages of competition. Hence, it seems to be an important organizational task to adjust kick-off times in a way that eliminates any advantage driven by the schedule."

In light of this distinction, the researchers ask the clubs why they take part in QCP and what they want to get out of it. This paper also invites reflections on the more troublesome part of voluntary organizations’ participation in processes of professionalization. Finally, we explore what the clubs understand to be the driving forces behind the programme and discuss whether these factors are conducive to the aims that the clubs have for their participation.Research Methods: The data comprise semi-structured interviews with 22 football clubs analysed by theme-based coding and categorization.Results and Findings: Clubs take part in QCP because they are expected to (i.e. institutionalization), to increase their autonomy and to improve their control over important resources: volunteers (i.e. resource dependency). To achieve this, the clubs see better routines, more predictability and improved structure as imperative. This study’s results show that what clubs report as making the programme function does not always work in favour of the clubs’ aims.Implications: The findings indicate that broad, multi-institutional approaches and action-oriented theories are necessary for understanding the choices and actions of voluntary sport clubs. Also shown is how the tools chosen for organizational development could be contrary to organizations’ aims."

Through an examination of network parameters and shifting structures, the analyses disclosed patterns of attention and power distributed among various sport stakeholders and fans. It advanced the inquiry of sport social media ecologies by engaging in theoretical discussions of media gatekeeping and power dynamics.Research methods: The study employed a social network analysis. A data scraping software was utilized to collect all conversations attached to #UCL during the pre-match, halftime, and post-match. Overall, the data included 19,869 posts for pre-match, 3276 posts for halftime, and 5691 for post-match.Results and findings: The #UCL network emerged with relatively low density and heterogeneous communication interest during the pre-match, and then moved towards higher density. Meanwhile, emergent game dynamics played a meaningful role in structuring the networked relationships. Large sport entities and star players, including the Champions League and Cristiano Ronaldo, had relatively stable and privileged positions in organizing the networks.Implications: The results indicated that the Twitter network structures allowed the prominence of large sport entities to be further recognized and legitimated, whereas individual citizens had constrained capacity to generate influence.

Utilizing ambush marketing as a framework to guide our examination of athletes’ adherence to Rule 40, the purpose of this study was to examine Olympic athletes’ social media posts from the 2016 Olympic Games to determine whether athletes violated Rule 40 and therefore engaged in ambush marketing.Research methods: Using content analysis, this study examined 100 randomly selected U.S. Olympic athletes’ social media posts on Instagram for a six-week time period before, during, and after the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. Frequencies, chi square, and independent samples t-tests were calculated with SPSS25.Results and findings: Significant differences in posting behaviors existed during the three time periods, and over 19% of all posts during the blackout period violated Rule 40, indicating a form of ambush marketing by the athletes. Additionally, athletes appeared to miss opportunities to highlight their personal sponsors and build their athlete brand after the Games.Implications: Athletes play a role in the Olympic ambush marketing network, whether intentionally or unintentionally, and Rule 40 enforcement issues were apparent, leading to questions about its feasibility. Athletes’ brand-building efforts should extend to the time period after the Olympic Games, as they have the ability to highlight sponsors in their posts to a greater degree during this timeframe."

The purpose of this paper is to analyse how nations position themselves in the Winter Games by comparing national funding prioritisations of Olympic Winter sports.Research methods: The distribution of funding in 2010/2011 is used as a proxy to examine how eight nations prioritise among seven sports. National policies are analysed at two levels: (a) the concentration of funding among the supported sports is measured using the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index (HHI) and (b) the Spearman’s rho coefficient is used to examine the correlations between the distribution of funding (2010/2011) and success per sport in the past (1992–2006), recent past (2010) and future (2014).Results and findings: All nations show some prioritisation, but the resulting distribution of funding differs. For example, South Korea diversifies its funding most equally (HHI = 0.18), while Switzerland’s funding is more concentrated (HHI = 0.46). Furthermore, positioning differs depending on the type of sport most prioritised, be it skiing (Australia, Canada, Finland and Switzerland), skating (Japan and the Netherlands), both (South Korea) or bobsleigh/skeleton (Great Britain). Meanwhile, high correlation values were found for Australia, Great Britain, Finland and Japan in all periods, while the Netherlands, Canada, South Korea and Switzerland show high values in specific periods only.

This investigation started with the following research question: Can constraints explain some variance in attendance intentions above and beyond that explained by team identification?Research methodsTo answer this question, we proposed a model with team identification as the exogenous construct, constraints as the mediator, and attendance intentions as the endogenous construct. We first conducted a pilot test (n = 675) via confirmatory factor analysis to investigate the psychometric properties of the constraint scale. Then, we applied structural equation modeling to test the measurement model and the proposed structural model using a second sample of fans (n = 583).Results and findingsResults showed that the indirect effect of team identification on attendance through perceptions of barriers was small, mainly because of the small relationship between team identification and constraints. A direct effects model was deemed to be a better structural representation of the relationships between constraints and intentions to attend, controlling for team identification.ImplicationsManaging and removing barriers might increase attendance intentions above and beyond the parcel associated with team identification. Not highly identified fans can be attracted to stadiums not only by becoming more identified (the traditional view), but also by perceiving less barriers (the alternative view)."

The previous studies on the subject provided mixed results regarding the spillover effects of sport-induced emotions on memory. Thus, the current manuscript attempts to answer the question ‘how do emotional reactions to a sporting event influence recall for ads broadcasted during the game?’Research methods : The current experiment – involving a 2 (Game outcome: victory, defeat) × 2 (Game process: close, lopsided) × 2 (Video instantiation) repeated measure factorial design – was conducted in a psychophysiological laboratory. A total of 51 undergraduate students from a large public university completed this study. Real-time (e.g. facial muscle, electrodermal, and cardiac activity) and self-assessed data (e.g. emotions, memory tests) data were collected while watching experimental stimuli.Results and Findings Both real-time (e.g. heart rate) and self-assessed (e.g. recall) data showed robust and consistent patterns regarding the spillover effects, which firmly supported the theoretical prediction of Limited Capacity Model for Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP). Attention and memory for subsequent advertising significantly vary depending on whether the favored team won and how close the game was.Implications This study makes unique sport management contributions by using a different theoretical perspective (i.e. LC4MP) and different methodology (i.e. psychophysiological experiment). The current study broadens our understanding of the relationship among team performance, emotions, and cognitions. Also, the findings imply that different advertising strategies for brand awareness should be implemented depending on specific game situations."

The purpose of this study was to examine the reaction of fans of a professional cycling team to a sponsorship terminating, which ultimately led to the team disbanding.Research methods: The research purpose was pursued through digital ethnography (via message boards and weblog), examining the case of Basque professional cycling fans. Comments were analysed to understand fans’ reaction to the 2013 cessation of Euskaltel-Euskadi, a Basque professional cycling team, after its sponsor, Euskaltel, exited the partnership.Results and findings: Fan reaction to Euskaltel ending its sponsorship was somewhat paradoxical, in that the terminated sponsorship ultimately led to the team disbanding, yet fans appeared to be appreciative of Euskaltel. They continued to celebrate the team’s corporate sponsor colour as they mourned the end of Euskaltel-Euskadi and questioned the future of Basque cycling. This reaction is made more logical by understanding the long-term duration of the partnership, and how Euskaltel’s support of the team for nearly two decades led to the intermeshing of the team and its sponsor, thus avoiding negative sentiment.Implications: This study makes a meaningful contribution to the sponsorship literature, particularly sponsorship termination. This study is one of the first to examine consumer response to sponsorship termination in a real-world setting, and suggests a potential legacy effect of long-term sponsorship, such that fan reaction to a long-term sponsorship terminating may not be negative, especially if fans understand the sponsor’s contribution over time."

It can also provide practical insight for sport managers regarding ways to help employees engage in their work without tipping over into workaholism.Research Methods: We used a structural modeling approach to examine the relationship between work engagement, workaholism, and work-family conflict. This model was tested within the context of a large, diverse sample of athletic department employees (N = 4,167).Results and Findings: Results indicated a significant, positive relationship between work engagement and workaholism. We also found that work-family conflict partially mediates this relationship, which suggests work-family conflict may deter highly engaged workers from turning into workaholics. Finally, we also found the participants’ job flexibility and participants’ gender were correlated with their reported levels of work engagement and workaholism.Implications: These findings suggest that in certain conditions engaged workers are at risk of transitioning to workaholics. It also suggests work-family conflict could act as a buffer to this transition. This study provides empirical support for a relationship previously conceptualized but untested within the business literature."

One of them is sports betting and the uncertainty regarding the effects of lockdown on bettors’ behaviour. This paper explores four key questions about sports bettors during covid-19: (1) have they ceased their sports betting? (2) Have they substituted betting for other online gambling activities (or esports)? (3) Have they saved more time or money?, and (4) How do they feel about their betting?Research methods The study reports findings from an online survey. Data was collected during the pandemic outbreak and before any major sport competition resumed its activity (5–7 May 2020). The survey was conducted in Poland. A purposive sampling method was used to reach regular sport bettors – where ‘regular’ means those who had bet at least once a month before covid-19. In total, 240 regular sports bettors completed the questionnaire in full. A binominal logistic regression model was used to analyse the behavioural changes of bettors during the pandemic.Results and findings The findings showed that most bettors ceased or seriously reduced their betting. In general, they did not substitute it with other forms of gambling. The majority of respondents saved time and money. Many of them also declared not missing betting.Implications The results did not depict sports bettors as desperate to resume betting, and willing to substitute it for any other gambling form in order to maintain their gambling habit. The betting industry’s efforts to mitigate the impact of sport events cancellations by promoting virtual sports, esports, or other casino games do not seem to be especially attractive for regular sports bettors."

It helps answer the following research question: how and for whom volunteer programmes work, in what circumstances, to what effect and over what duration. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the theoretical and practical value of combining the Volunteer Process Model (VPM) (Omoto & Snyder, 2002), Human Resource Management (HRM) Model (Cuskelly et al., 2006) and Legacy Cube (Preuss, 2007). This theoretical synergy helps unpack ‘what’ we study, while the premises of critical realist evaluation (Pawson, 2013) ‘Context + Mechanism = Outcome’ (CMO) aid in answering ‘why’ and ‘how’ we study it.Research methods The London 2012 Olympic Games volunteer (Games Maker or GM) programme was the primary case for this research. Data was gathered before, during and 14 months after the Games in the UK via a mixed methods approach. Survey data from volunteers was complemented with semi-structured interviews with volunteers and managers, the author’s participant observations and documentary analysis.Results and findings The proposed framework helped identify and evaluate the systems, mechanisms, and processes of developing and managing the GM programme. It became evident that unless key event stakeholders acknowledge the complex nature of Olympic volunteering and put adequate structures, resources and practices in place, the volunteer programmes are ineffective in managing volunteers and attaining a sustainable volunteering legacy.Implications This paper offers valuable insights into the organisation and management of Olympic volunteering to achieve various programme results. It answers a call for a holistic approach to the phenomenon under study and features new directions for continued academic research in this critical area."

Furthermore, research indicates that field-configuring events (FCE), such as conferences, which temporarily unite actors, are important junctures for institutional processes. Research is yet to address how FCE intersect with the effectiveness of institutional work. The aim of this paper is to explore how (i) the legitimacy of an actor at the time of an FCE, and (ii) the co-location of actors at an FCE impact institutional work effectiveness.Research methods The 1999 Lausanne Conference is used as a case study because it led to significant institutional disruption in the field of anti-doping through the creation of the Lausanne Declaration. To analyse these institutional processes, a qualitative thematic analysis of 624 newspaper articles and archival documents from the conference was conducted.Results and Findings Firstly, we demonstrate that institutional maintenance can fail if an actor’s legitimacy is under challenge at the time of an FCE. Secondly, the co-location of likeminded actors can create a consensus that acts as a cue to enable institutional disruption.Implications Based on the findings, suggestions are made to inform decision-making processes about institutional work.

Furthermore, research indicates that field-configuring events (FCE), such as conferences, which temporarily unite actors, are important junctures for institutional processes. Research is yet to address how FCE intersect with the effectiveness of institutional work. The aim of this paper is to explore how (i) the legitimacy of an actor at the time of an FCE, and (ii) the co-location of actors at an FCE impact institutional work effectiveness.Research methods The 1999 Lausanne Conference is used as a case study because it led to significant institutional disruption in the field of anti-doping through the creation of the Lausanne Declaration. To analyse these institutional processes, a qualitative thematic analysis of 624 newspaper articles and archival documents from the conference was conducted.Results and Findings Firstly, we demonstrate that institutional maintenance can fail if an actor’s legitimacy is under challenge at the time of an FCE. Secondly, the co-location of likeminded actors can create a consensus that acts as a cue to enable institutional disruption.Implications Based on the findings, suggestions are made to inform decision-making processes about institutional work.

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses that control for stylistic response behavior were conducted to assess the psychometric properties of the scale.Results and findings: The OVS contains 12 items that load onto three factors: (1) appreciation of diversity, (2) friendly relations with others, and (3) achievement in competition. An additional enjoyment-related factor lacked discriminant validity and, thus, was not included in the OVS. The scale is valid and reliable in both English (here: USA) and German (here: Germany).

The Herfindahl index and concentration ratios of the four/eight most funded sports (CR4/CR8) are used as proxies for prioritisation. Success was measured using top three and top eight places during the Olympic Games and World Championships. Descriptive analysis and linear regression are applied to identify the relationship between the distribution of funding and success.Results and findings: Generally, all sample nations are prioritisers. Nations with smaller total elite sport budgets tended to prioritise more. There is a slight negative association between the distribution of funding within a country and subsequent success, indicating that the sample countries that prioritise more tended to be less successful.

This is redressed in this study by determining whether immediate preferences towards new local teams can be observed in the broader viewing behaviour of the general population within local markets. The consumption of new sport teams is then tracked longitudinally to understand the influence of consumer novelty on market behaviour.Research methods: The study analysed television ratings data of a new Australian cricket league. The period of analysis spanned five seasons from 2013/2014 through to 2017/2018. Data analysis included independent samples t-tests and hierarchical linear modelling.Results and findings: Each local market exhibited an immediate preference for their local team. Local viewing preference for local teams did not grow over time, with the relative audience of local and non-local team fixtures increasing proportionally over the period. The league appears to be towards the end of its novelty phase, evidenced by a stabilisation in viewing commitment yet retraction in base audience size between season three and five.Implications: The ability of new teams to solicit immediate local viewing preferences within the general population confirms the salience of geography as a foundational component of team identity. New teams should strategically consider their alignment to a suburban, city, state, or regional identity. That preference towards local teams did not increase within local markets reflects a critical theoretic distinction from more identified fan segments in which connection to team is thought to typically grow over time."

New teams should strategically consider their alignment to a suburban, city, state, or regional identity.

In the absence of more specific analyses of leagues in developing countries, an implicit assumption is that the demand for football across different economies is homogenous. However, such an assumption may lead to inappropriate policies. Therefore, decision-making and policies aimed at attendance and pricing in developing countries should be substantiated with empirical evidence reflecting their settings.Research methods: This paper models match level attendance demand and price in the first tier of the Peruvian football league from 2012 to 2016 inclusive. Using a sample of 1719 matches, two-stage least-squares estimation with instrumental variables is used.Results and findings: We find that attendance in the Peruvian football league is driven by market size, distance between teams and recent performance while local rivalry and price do not exert significant impacts. More importantly, attendance exhibits properties of an inferior good given its relationship with levels of poverty and associated correlation with income.Implications: The implications are that demand models for football in developing and developed economies generate different results as the impacts of some exogenous variables on attendance offer different outcomes. For example, the impact of price and income differ from prior expectations indicating that different approaches are necessary to managing football in developing countries including distinct policies on stadium accommodation."

This study investigated determinants of support for a major sport event. The key independent variables were perceived event-related personal impacts and perceived event-related community impacts.Research Methods Residents (n = 603) of two potential Commonwealth Games host cities in New Zealand were asked about their support for the event. Event impact perceptions (costs and benefits) across personal and community dimensions were measured. The triple bottom line approach complements social exchange theory and social representations theory to underpin this study. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse the relationship between impacts and event support. Ordinal logistic regression was used to analyse the relationship between the levels of the event impacts (i.e. personal and community) and event support. Paired sample t-tests were used to explore difference between personal and community quality of life perceptions based on each of the event impacts.Results and Findings Overall, residents were supportive of bidding for the Commonwealth Games and various event impact perceptions are related. Based on Social Representations Theory, residents likely view the positive benefits of hosting a major event of this type as outweighing the negative. Several significant impacts emerged – both positive and negative. Positive impacts (pride) were perceived to have the greatest effect on event support, whereas each of the negative impact perceptions (opportunity cost, justice) were linked to decreased event support.Implications The results of this study provide important insights on community member perceptions of major sport events. The tendency of community members to focus on negatives could be counteracted with targeted communication strategies."

Event impact perceptions (costs and benefits) across personal and community dimensions were measured. The triple bottom line approach complements social exchange theory and social representations theory to underpin this study. Multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse the relationship between impacts and event support. Ordinal logistic regression was used to analyse the relationship between the levels of the event impacts (i.e. personal and community) and event support. Paired sample t-tests were used to explore difference between personal and community quality of life perceptions based on each of the event impacts.Results and Findings Overall, residents were supportive of bidding for the Commonwealth Games and various event impact perceptions are related. Based on Social Representations Theory, residents likely view the positive benefits of hosting a major event of this type as outweighing the negative. Several significant impacts emerged – both positive and negative. Positive impacts (pride) were perceived to have the greatest effect on event support, whereas each of the negative impact perceptions (opportunity cost, justice) were linked to decreased event support.Implications The results of this study provide important insights on community member perceptions of major sport events. The tendency of community members to focus on negatives could be counteracted with targeted communication strategies."

However, until this study there were no uniform ways to evaluate these efforts. To this end, the purpose of this study is to create and test the sport sustainability campaign evaluation model among sport participants of a 10-mile run event.Research methods: We tested the fit of the sport sustainability campaign evaluation model using 531 participants of a community run.Results and Findings: Needs, values, internal constraints, and points of attachment explained 52.1% of the variance in attitudes toward the campaign. Attitudes, external constraints, past behavior and all of the indirect effects of the other variables combined, explained 74.2% of the variance in participating in sustainability initiatives. Sport professionals can use this model to assess environmental sustainability campaigns and promote attitudinal and sustainable behaviors.Implications: The findings of this study have important implications for sport managers and marketers as they create and further advance their organization’s sustainability campaigns. Understanding the needs and values of sport participants can help marketers and managers determine how those needs and values affect positive attitudes towards the campaign. Increasing the positive attitudes towards the campaign, while minimizing the negative influence of external constraints to act sustainably, can increase sustainable behavioral intentions and thus increase the success of the sport organization’s sustainability campaign.

Novelty seeking behavior and scarcity were two theories used to hypothesize consumer preference during Beckman’s tenure in MLS, and to understand the potential return on this substantial league investment.Research methods: The sampling frame for this study was all MLS games that occurred during David Beckham’s tenure, from 2007 to 2012. A total of 1473 game observations were examined in this investigation. A censored panel regression was estimated using both random and fixed effects models. A total of 25 determinants of attendance were examined, including Beckham’s overall impact, home and road impact, and year-by-year impact.Results and findings: Findings showed David Beckham’s presence had a significant impact on MLS attendance. Specifically the biggest impact was seen in attendance at road games, providing evidence of a return on the marketing investment made by the league. Additionally, when examining the year-by-year impact of Beckham, both a novelty and scarcity effect were present.Implications: These findings contribute to the marketing literature on the impact of star performers in the sport and entertainment industry. The current investigation extends the knowledge on strategic marketing at the league level, particularly for a single-entity ownership model. Additionally, this examination highlights the factors that help to explain consumer preference changes over a prolonged period, such as novelty and scarcity."

We conclude that the investments in player talent are made under high risk of outcome uncertainty and economic investors do not, or to a lesser extent, monitor club managers’ actions and do not serve as a CG mechanism.Implications: This implies a need for football clubs’ investors to redefine their role to ensure a functioning governance system. The results further imply that archival CG research in football clubs should acknowledge the dynamic relationship between CG mechanisms and a club’s performance."

An appropriate methodology is adopted to address the selection bias that arises because Europa League participants tend to be stronger than other teams in their league due to the qualification criteria for pan-European competition.Research methods: Longitudinal data is used consisting of European teams in the top division of their country’s national league in the period 2009–10 to 2017–18. In order to address the selection bias, the regression discontinuity design estimator is employed.Results and findings: The results show no statistically significant effect from participation in the Europa League group stage on performance in national leagues for teams from stronger leagues but a positive and statistically significant effect for teams from weaker leagues.Implications: The results suggest that the knowledge gained and/or the financial benefits from group stage participation outweigh any negative effects arising from the travel and additional games required by participation in the group stages of the Europa League in weaker leagues. They are therefore supportive of increasing the share of UEFA competition revenues given to non-participating clubs in order to mitigate the negative effect of these competitions on domestic competitive balance."

It introduces a framework on the basis of compliance theory to analyse IFs’ recent self-regulation initiatives, namely the Basic Universal Principles of Good Governance of the Olympic and Sports Movement (PGG) and the Key Governance Principles and Basic Indicators (KGP).Research methods: The analysis relies primarily on an extensive document analysis. In addition, 7 semi-structured interviews with officials who participate in relevant policy processes were conducted. The data were coded on the basis of the six compliance mechanisms identified in the theoretical framework.Results and findings: The empirical analysis demonstrates that the PGG’s system includes only general persuasion and social learning stimulation while the KGP’s system includes mechanisms that promote knowledge transfer, rule specification, persuasion, and social learning. These mechanisms constitute a necessary step towards truly achieving a common governance standard in IFs. However, because the KGP’s system lacks fully independent external monitoring of minimum criteria and because non-compliant federations do not face sanctions, this system is not likely to achieve the universal adoption of good governance by IFs.Implications: The universal implementation of good governance standards in IFs requires either co-regulation, where self- regulation’s persuasion and management mechanisms are supplemented by sanctions implemented by public and/or civil society actors, or meta-regulation, which entails that public actors impose a minimum standard for self-regulation that includes robust monitoring and sanctioning mechanisms."

Particularly in Europe, golf clubs rely on income from memberships. We examine the factors that are generally relevant to golfers when paying green fees or becoming club members. We compare the findings to evaluate the differences between the two revenue sources.Research methods: We compile a database of N = 669 German golf courses for the 2015 season to test the hedonic price models of membership fees compared to green fees on both weekdays and weekends. In addition, beyond the attributes of golf courses that are usually investigated in the literature and can be characterized as market determinants, we capture management determinants such as quality certificates. A comparison of the log-linear ordinary least squares and quantile regressions on the three price constructs reveals fruitful insights for price differentiation.Results and findings: The empirical analysis indicates that the dispersion of membership fees among golf clubs can mainly be explained by differences in the number of holes, the golf course’s difficulty, its proximity to a large city, and two certificates. For the pricing of green fees, the number of holes, a competitive market situation, and the course’s difficulty and age are important factors.Implications: The findings indicate not only the similarities but also the differences between memberships and green fees. In terms of practical applications for golf clubs, developing group-specific marketing strategies and suitable offers for club members and guest golfers would help improve long-term club viability."

The need for young players to balance training and commitment to eSports with broader educational requirements is highlighted.Implications The paper provides evidence on the need for a holistic developmental model for eSports players which provides better understanding of players’ careers and developmental needs. The study highlights a need for collective engagement and effort by various stakeholders in developing player-centred support schemes. Drawing on evidence from key stakeholders, the study proposes a modified categorisation of the eSports ecosystem model."

",Isidoro Guzmán,first,"a  Politechnic University of Cartagena ,  Spain",Measuring Efficiency and Sustainable Growth in Spanish Football Teams,2006-12-22,6,3,267-287,"Strategy and Management, Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management"," Abstract  Professional football clubs are special businesses since their performance is deemed from two different objectives: success on the field and success in business performance. Thus, efficiency levels can be measured by means of the sport performance from matches played or the financial performance from financial statements. Moreover, economic growth becomes a good indicator of company dynamic behaviour, by measuring the capacity of a company to improve its financial and commercial possibilities. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to assess the level of financial performance of Spanish football clubs and the relationship thereof with the target for growth based on a parameter of revenue. Efficiency measurements were analysed using a benchmark procedure developed by Charnes et al. (1978 Charnes, A., Cooper, W. W. and Rhodes, E. 1978. Measuring the efficiency of decision making units. European Journal of Operational Research, 2: 429–444. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]), data envelopment analysis (DEA) and also productivity levels by calculating the Malmquist productivity index based on DEA scores. Sustainable growth figures were also calculated using the Higgins (1977 Higgins, R. C. 1977. How much growth can a firm afford?. Financial Management, 6: 7–16. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]) model considering the measure of real growth to be the increase in the revenue for each period analysed. From a sample of Spanish professional football teams in the 2000–1 to 2002–3 seasons, our findings show that only a small number of clubs show improvements in technological change and in approaching the efficiency frontier. Moreover evidence was found that those clubs with the smallest difference between both growth ratios (real and sustainable) prove to be more efficient. "

Post-event questionnaires measured rational and affective motivational antecedents of intention, while the behavior was measured through sport program participation within one year following the event.Results and findings: Structural equation modeling revealed that rational (i.e. attitude toward the behavior, perceived behavioral control, descriptive norm) and affective (i.e. inspiration) motivational mechanisms significantly predicted intention, and intention, was a small but statistically significant predictor of participation.Implications: Scholars should consider the integration of both rational (e.g. participation constraints) and affective-based (e.g. inspiration) motivational mechanisms when modeling sport participation behaviors. Practitioners should consider designing event leveraging strategies that expand youth’s social networks (e.g. youth activities during event intermissions) and create experiential conditions which induce a state of inspiration (e.g. having athletes speak to youth after the event)."

Interestingly, at present, sport management research has not provided a definitive answer to this critical question.Research methods In this short paper, we address this question by exploring German TV audience demand for all 404 handball games broadcast during the three most recent seasons: 2015/16, 2016/17 and 2017/18.Results and findings Our results suggest that, despite hopes to the contrary, moving from a primarily free TV-based distribution strategy to a largely pay TV-based approach has decreased rather than increased the audience reach of the Handball-Bundesliga. On a more general note, we observe a positive role of both game outcome uncertainty and the absence of simultaneous fixtures in shaping German TV demand for professional handball. As such, our empirical results complement the otherwise rich literature on the determinants for professional sports by providing a first look at the potential determinants of niche sports TV demand, a previously neglected topic in sport management research.Implications Niche sport federations have to reflect carefully on their TV marketing strategy under digital plenitude."

This article identifies four antecedent factors underpinning the formation of the Our Tottenham community network: a network formed by community groups in Tottenham to challenge, inter-alia, the stadium-led regeneration scheme.Research methods: The research draws on a longitudinal, qualitative case study, involving interviews, participant observation of community meetings, and analysis of documents.Results and Findings: Four factors underpinned the development of the Our Tottenham community network. The erosion of local democracy and the violation of reciprocity are categorised as reactive forces, in which mobilisation occurred as a response to the behaviour of the Council and the football club. Protecting community interests and increasing salience were driven more by the needs of the community and are categorised as proactive forces underpinning mobilisation.Implications: In the context of this case study, we argue that mobilising efforts occurred due to the presence of both reactive and proactive forces. This helped the Our Tottenham network to build a salient stakeholder coalition. The findings also suggest that focal organisations need to recognise how their behaviour can create the antecedent conditions for stakeholder mobilisation and put in place structures that enable community stakeholders to have a voice during stadium-led regeneration."

The current case study investigated these exchange relationships within collegiate sport clubs (CSCs) through examining the following research question. What are the characteristics and outcomes of the social exchange relationships within CSCs?Research methods : Guided by social exchange theory and social constructivist epistemology, the researchers conducted focus groups with representatives from 29 clubs and interviews with four recreation professional staff at three universities across the United States.Results and findings : Analysis of the transcripts found multiple exchange relationships exist within CSCs, with primary importance placed on the relationships between the club’s executive board and club members, and the club members and the university. Each exchange relationship was found to contribute to specific desirable outcomes for the engaged actors that could not be had without the exchange partner.Implications : Analysis of the findings led to recommendations for practitioners on how to maximize the outcomes of the found exchange relationships and maintain quality exchanges between actors."

Five sources of interpersonal power have been identified in the literature (reward, coercive, referent, legitimate and expert powers). These interpersonal powers were later adapted to sport settings and sound validity and reliability results have been shown in North America. Participants were 165 male soccer head coaches and 870 male soccer players (697 amateur and 173 professionals) in this study. Confirmatory and Exploratory factor analyses with the data collected in Turkey supported the four-factor model for coaches and players with the elimination of some items (items 1, 6, 7, 9 and 11). To some extent, cultural convergence and divergences appear to exist between both multicultural countries (USA and Turkey) related to perception of leadership power. Additional new items and models may be needed for soccer in Turkey. "

In this situation of uncertainty, it is necessary to be aware of these perceptions and to develop strategies to involve the citizens in the development of these events."

Specifically, we investigate how high versus low displays of social atmospherics in pictures and videos affect consumers’ cognitive (attributions of attractiveness to the league) and affective (emotional arousal) responses. In addition, we analyze how these responses transfer to intentions to watch future broadcasts.Research methods The hypotheses are tested in two online experiments using one-factorial (social atmospherics: high versus low) between-subjects designs. The research context is German sport media consumers and promotional material of the Australian Football League (AFL).Results and findings The findings suggest that displaying high (versus low) social atmospherics in pictures can increase the perceived attractiveness that consumers attribute to a new sport league, while such content in videos increases consumers’ emotional arousal. These cognitive and affective processes transfer to intentions to view future broadcasts of the league.Implications Our findings imply that while on-site fans are declining in relative numbers in media-dominated professional team sport markets, these fans are highly relevant for the success of team sport-related media offers and the attraction of new consumers."

One recent study refuted that consumers’ attitude towards advertising was rather favourable in sport. This study compared consumers’ attitudes between advertising and sponsorship in sport and examined the antecedents (beliefs) and consequence (purchase intentions) of attitude in advertising and sponsorship.Research methods: Data were collected from 324 consumers. For testing of psychometric properties of the measures, a confirmatory factor analysis and a multiple invariance test were employed. A paired t-test, structural equation modelling, and invariance tests were conducted to test the research hypotheses.Results and Findings: There was no significant difference in consumers’ attitudes between advertising and sponsorship which were both deemed favourable. The path analyses revealed two positive beliefs (product information and hedonism/pleasure) and one negative belief (falsity/no sense) as significant predictors of attitude in both models. Good for the economy was an additional significant predictor of attitude in advertising but it was not so in sponsorship. The strengths of the three path coefficients were statistically identical across the two models. Attitude was a significant indicator of purchase intentions in both models; however, the invariance test revealed that the path in adverting was statistically stronger than that in sponsorship.Implications: This study provides important knowledge about consumers’ cognitive structures that could explain their decision making processes.

This structure allows us to test the existence of discouragement effect, according to which biathletes reduce their efforts when lagging far behind the leaders.Research Methods: We use data on all 180 mass start competitions, for both genders, in World Cups, World Championships, and Olympic Games between the 2001/02 and 2019/20 seasons, and compare the gap times between the two consecutive ranks. For the same period, we execute the same analyses for all sprint and individual competitions that use interval starts.Results and Findings: We find that, in mass starts, the 95% confidence intervals of the gap times between the two consecutive ranks overlap in the range of rankings between 3 and 25 among men and between 5 and 24 among women, with mean gaps of 6.6 and 7.7 seconds among men and women, respectively. However, that gap increases sharply for the four bottom ranks (that is, ranks 27–30), which have mean gaps of 29.8 and 31.2 sec among men and women, respectively. However, in sprint and individual races, the lag time between two consecutive ranks does not exceed 4 (sprint) and 10 (individual) seconds in the range of rankings between 10 and 60.Implications: The results suggest that bottom-ranked biathletes in mass starts strategically reduce their efforts when there is nothing at stake. Such a strategy increases the duration of TV broadcasts and does not help maximize suspense, which is one of the main drivers of TV demands in professional sports. We offer an alternative format, according to which a certain number of the bottom-ranked biathletes will be eliminated after each bout of shooting. Such a format should dramatically increase the suspense-to-time ratio."

Some interesting instruments were revealed that enhanced legitimacy and trust in the network; namely, leveraging expertise and knowledge; engaging in collaborative goal setting; establishing a task force; and engaging in co-optation tactics.Implementation: This research adds to the collaborative network literature by explicitly linking perceptions of power and resource-dependency to the decision-making and coordination processes. The results contribute to research on elite sport by bringing insights into the relationships among resource-dependency, power, decision-making and coordination; and into the usefulness of the instruments to handle potential pitfalls inherent to these relationships."

Previous studies operationalise ABI at a higher-order construct level, and/or measure ABI using formative measures. Such operationalisations obscure potentially different relationships between ABI’s image attributes and PC.Research methods: A questionnaire was used to collect data from 197 UK respondents over a six-day period within two weeks of the Rio 2016 Olympics concluding. Data were analysed through structural equation modelling (SEM) and fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) techniques.Results and findings: Through SEM, the ABI attributes, athletic expertise, life story, role model, and competition style are positively related to PC, sportsmanship and symbol are negatively related, and rivalry, physical attractiveness, body fit, and relationship effort are nonsignificantly related. Many structural paths between ABI’s attributes and PC are also significantly different. Through fsQCA, high PC exists under three complex ABI attribute configurations, while it is absent under four complex configurations.Implications: Theoretically, finding different relationships between ABI’s attributes and PC highlights why operationalising ABI at the dimension-level provides a more in-depth understanding of athlete brand image’s effects on PC. Managerially, the findings suggest athletes need only a subset of ABI attributes for high PC. Subsequently, managers can more-efficiently and effectively direct resources towards those attributes that best-capitalise on athletes’ images."

This research defines the construct of perceived fan participation in decision making and explores the construct’s antecedents and consequences.Research methods: This research applies a sequence of exploratory and confirmatory methods and uses the German football league Bundesliga as the empirical context. Based on in-depth interviews with 33 football fans, this research defines perceived fan participation and develops a framework of the construct’s antecedents and consequences. Two studies (N = 237 and N = 834) validate the framework and examine its relationships using confirmatory factor analyses and structural equation modeling.Results and findings: I define fan participation as a perception of the degree of collective influence that the fans have on their favorite club’s decisions and decision-making processes. The findings suggest that perceived fan recognition, perceived transparency in managerial decisions, and perceived goal congruence between fans and managers positively influence fans’ participation perceptions. The consequences of the construct include acceptance of management decisions, reduced feelings of estrangement from the club and positive extra-role behavior.Implications: I introduce the construct of perceived fan participation and initiate a theory-building process by providing a framework of the construct’s antecedents and consequences.

In doing so, this study has sought to not only increase the understanding of a previously under-researched group – female STHs – but to also gain managerially useful insights into how female fans might be attracted to, and retained, as STHs.Research methods: Data were collected from almost 14,000 STHs from 12 professional sport teams. Guided by past work on the antecedents of STH satisfaction, the dataset was split by gender and matched on key variables, before established satisfaction models were tested across groups.Results and findings: Overall, STH satisfaction appears to be derived the same way, regardless of gender. However, the relative importance of different aspects of the STH experience often varies. Customer service and home ground facilities are significantly more important among females. Men instead derive more satisfaction from feeling involved with the team and the way it is managed.

In doing so, this study has sought to not only increase the understanding of a previously under-researched group – female STHs – but to also gain managerially useful insights into how female fans might be attracted to, and retained, as STHs.Research methods: Data were collected from almost 14,000 STHs from 12 professional sport teams. Guided by past work on the antecedents of STH satisfaction, the dataset was split by gender and matched on key variables, before established satisfaction models were tested across groups.Results and findings: Overall, STH satisfaction appears to be derived the same way, regardless of gender. However, the relative importance of different aspects of the STH experience often varies. Customer service and home ground facilities are significantly more important among females. Men instead derive more satisfaction from feeling involved with the team and the way it is managed. These differences are explained in light of what is known about gender differences in relation to consumption motives and behaviors.Implications: This study provides valuable insights for sport or team managers into the factors that drive satisfaction for both female and male STHs, including concomitant positioning strategies to grow female STH numbers.

This study seeks to bridge the gap by investigating whether abnormal returns occur at well-known European football clubs before the announcement of the transfer.Research method: Using an event study methodology, the effect of 272 player purchases between 2015 and 2019 were analysed. The abnormal returns were estimated by applying a partial adjustment model containing the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity specification; then, the typical runs of cumulative abnormal returns were identified.Results and findings: In the vast majority of cases, the stock reacted to the announcement; moreover, in two-thirds of the transactions, information leakage was also established. Because the small shareholders of football clubs are, presumably, emotional investors, rather than rational ones, most of the transfers affect share prices even before the announcement; this is potentially because the acquisition of a star player strengthens both their commitment to the club and belief in its sporting success.Implications: This study provides some managerial implications for football club owners, managers, and regulators. Although there is information leakage, it is not of such a magnitude as to require the regulation of the stock market and bulk trading.

This paper examines the complex combination of organisational factors associated with CSR implementation in a sport federation (SF) setting. Thus, this study identifies organisational factors of professionalisation for CSR implementation and different configurations associated with CSR implementation.Research methods: The study adopted a comparative approach combining a survey, interviews, and organisational documents in a sample of 19 Belgian SFs. A crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (csQCA) was carried out to identify the combination of organisational factors associated with CSR implementation.Results and Findings: This study identifies four configurations associated with high CSR implementation and three configurations with low CSR implementation. Innovation capacity is a necessary organisational factor for CSR implementation that should be combined with financial autonomy, knowledge and human resources. The study reveals that organisational size is not a key condition associated with CSR implementation.

Group one received the content direct from the athlete, whereas group two and three saw the same content presented by indirect sources (the athlete’s team and a news media outlet). In total, 315 consumers participated in the experiment.

It addresses what shapes the production of governance codes and who decides what aspects of governance to be quantified and how we govern and study the quantification of good governance in sport.Research methods:This is a position and conceptual paper, which reviews three international and two national codes to illustrate the five dimensions of the quantification of governance, including the work required, its reactivity, its tendency to discipline human behaviour, its polyvalent authority, and its aesthetics.Results and findings: The quantification of governance codes requires a significant amount of work and triggers compliance responses from sport organisations, which leads to structural changes and an ever-greater institutional complexity and need for capacity building. Quantification has challenged sport organisations’ autonomy as it does not promote self-governance but rather meta-governance. How the quantification of governance is related to its theorisation and codes’ accuracy validity remains problematic.Implications: The paper challenges the uncritical acceptance of good governance codes as a norm for sport organisations and calls for a reconsideration of our approach in line with a sport-focused model, which acknowledges the value systems, local traditions and institutional frameworks underpinning the model."

We examined how gaps between supporters’ expectations and teams’ achievements affect supporters’ wellbeing, and how social identity moderates this. Addressing previous methodological limitations, we examined such gaps objectively in a meaningful real-world scenario.Research methods We conducted a quasi-experiment around the 2018 FIFA World Cup with 278 supporters and 63 control participants, collecting data before, during, and after the championship. We also examined curvilinear effects and the moderating effect of social identity using polynomial regression surface modelling.Results and findings Supporters’ satisfaction increased when their national team's achievements exceeded expectations, decreased when achievements failed to exceed expectations, and remained stable for a control group. Happiness was unchanged in these conditions, however. Polynomial regression indicated that expectations and achievements explained a substantial 35% of incremental variance in satisfaction, and their three-dimensional curvilinear interaction accounted for a further 6% (a considerable 41% overall). The moderating effect of social identity on this relationship also approached significance.Implications Increases in achievements increase satisfaction, and disproportionately so for high achievements. However, satisfaction is also increased by lowering expectations, particularly for supporters identifying strongly with their teams. For supporters identifying less strongly, though, moderate expectations increase satisfaction most."

We also examined curvilinear effects and the moderating effect of social identity using polynomial regression surface modelling.Results and findings Supporters’ satisfaction increased when their national team's achievements exceeded expectations, decreased when achievements failed to exceed expectations, and remained stable for a control group. Happiness was unchanged in these conditions, however. Polynomial regression indicated that expectations and achievements explained a substantial 35% of incremental variance in satisfaction, and their three-dimensional curvilinear interaction accounted for a further 6% (a considerable 41% overall). The moderating effect of social identity on this relationship also approached significance.Implications Increases in achievements increase satisfaction, and disproportionately so for high achievements. However, satisfaction is also increased by lowering expectations, particularly for supporters identifying strongly with their teams. For supporters identifying less strongly, though, moderate expectations increase satisfaction most."

It questions whether capitalism should remain as the invisible, ghostly backdrop wherein sport management is located and conceptualized.Research methods This paper is primarily a position and conceptual paper, though it is foregrounded with a search of the term ‘capitalism’ within leading sport management academic journals, conference abstracts, and textbooks. It also provides a synopsis of capitalism (as a global system of power) and suggests that capitalism has a ghostly presence in contemporary sport management scholarship.Results and findings This paper advocates for an expansive understanding of ‘sport management’ as the organizing processes of sport activities, as opposed to the ‘managing’ modalities with capitalist values. Naming capitalism is a necessary first step for sport management research to become more accountable to social justice and emancipation.Implications Naming capitalism makes it analyzable. It opens up intellectual space to support multi-racial, multi-gender working-class and anti-colonial struggles within and beyond the sport industry, furthering existing analyses on racism, sexism, heteronormativity, ableism, etc. with a renewed focus on contradictions under capitalism. Moreover, it opens up possibilities to theorize non-capitalist forms of organizing sport that challenge the default logics of the sport ‘industry’."

An interdisciplinary study of health promotion through sport,2019-1-8,19,4,481-501,"Strategy and Management, Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management","ABSTRACTResearch questionDebates about dietary health promotion at sports events are becoming more prominent and are making food and drink sport sponsorship arrangements increasingly problematic. This study uses choice architecture as a guiding framework to examine how ideas about ‘healthy choices’ for customer food and drink were operationalised at the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Brazil.Research methodsAn interdisciplinary perspective was applied, whereby considerations of public health, marketing, psychology, policy studies, nutrition and event management informed the research. A multi-method approach was utilised, which included policy analysis, menu analysis, event process analysis, and interviews with spectators.

Using the Gaborone 2014 African Youth Games (AYG) as its research setting, the goal of this paper is to investigate how hosting a MSE can impact the perceived organisational capacity of sporting organisations within the context of a developing or transition economy.Research Method Data were gathered through 13 semi-structured interviews. Results are deductively coded and presented according to Hall et al.’s (2003) conceptualisation of organisational capacity.Results and Findings Results show that individuals perceived positive capacity outcomes related to skill development, international relationships and, in some instances, material resources. Conversely, adverse outcomes included lack of opportunities to apply new skills, strained relationships, and unmet financial expectations. Moreover, the findings reveal that the AYG generated similar capacity outcomes as other MSEs, but that the relative impact of those outcomes may differ.Implications The findings re-emphasise the need for hosts to engage in strategic management to maximise positive capacity outcomes. Researchers are encouraged to investigate the impact of MSEs on sport organisations using multiple methods and settings."

Pearson/Printice Hall. [Google Scholar]) was adapted to the context of SLG to fill the gap which remained unexamined in the team and league branding context by examining the relationship between BKNW, brand responses (BRP) and brand resonance (BR).Research methods A total of 412 fully completed surveys by Super Football League consumers were used to validate the measurement models and the proposed model using confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM).Results and findings Findings of the holistic CBBE model showed that, in order for a brand to obtain positive responses and to ‘resonate’ with league consumers, league brand associations (LBAS) play a pivotal role. Furthermore, obtaining cognitive responses such as brand credibility (BCRD) and affective responses such as emotional feelings from consumers can increase the degree of BR, which refers to the strongest relationship between consumers and brands.Implications Through the model presented, sports marketers will be able to better manage their league brand. They also better assess the strengths and weaknesses of the brand besides the effectiveness of marketing programs in achieving BR."

Therefore, in this study, the customer-based brand equity pyramid (CBBE-pyramid) (Keller, 2008 Keller, K. L. (2008). Strategic brand management: Building, measuring, and, managing brand equity (3rd ed.). Pearson/Printice Hall. [Google Scholar]) was adapted to the context of SLG to fill the gap which remained unexamined in the team and league branding context by examining the relationship between BKNW, brand responses (BRP) and brand resonance (BR).Research methods A total of 412 fully completed surveys by Super Football League consumers were used to validate the measurement models and the proposed model using confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM).Results and findings Findings of the holistic CBBE model showed that, in order for a brand to obtain positive responses and to ‘resonate’ with league consumers, league brand associations (LBAS) play a pivotal role. Furthermore, obtaining cognitive responses such as brand credibility (BCRD) and affective responses such as emotional feelings from consumers can increase the degree of BR, which refers to the strongest relationship between consumers and brands.Implications Through the model presented, sports marketers will be able to better manage their league brand. They also better assess the strengths and weaknesses of the brand besides the effectiveness of marketing programs in achieving BR."

As a result, knowledge is needed as to how and to what extent participants of PSEs modified their sport behaviour to fill the void of event cancellation. Therefore, this study aimed to (1) investigate to what extent event participants have modified their sport behaviour as a result of the COVID-19 measures, and (2) analyse the factors that determine participation in virtual events (real activities using an online recording platform).Research methods A total of 2869 respondents completed an online survey which was widely disseminated in Flanders (Belgium) six weeks after the announcement of the COVID-19 lockdown. The sample included both event and non-event participants. Descriptive and binary logistic regression analyses were used to investigate how event participants adapted their sport behaviour and which factors determined virtual event participation.Results and findings Since the COVID-19 measures, event participants did not decrease the frequency but only the intensity of their sport behaviour. Based on social ecological theory, participation in virtual events could be explained by both individual determinants (e.g. motivation towards developing skills), and interpersonal determinants (e.g. previous participation in a virtual event).Implications This study contributes to research on the impact of COVID-19 measures and consequently the cancellation of PSEs on sport behaviour of event participants.

How collective responsibility judgments of sport sponsors affect sponsee equity,2019-6-25,20,5,537-559,"Strategy and Management, Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management","ABSTRACTResearch question: Previous research has focused on sport sponsors, with little known on how sponsorship affects sponsee equity (e.g. audiences’ behaviors towards sponsees). Further, sponsorship research typically ignores concurrent sponsors, which are naturally perceived in terms of perceived ‘groupness’ (entitativity). In turn, entitativity will affect people's judgments of the collective responsibility (CR) sponsors have towards the properties they are associated with. To compound the issue, sponsees’ dependence on sponsors typically affords the latter authority that can also affect the CR people perceive sponsors have. We therefore examine how people's concurrent sponsors’ entitativity and perceived authority influence sponsee equity through CR.Research methods: Data were collected from 255 (Study one) and 233 (Study two) consumers in a European country. Data collection consisted of scenario-based surveys. Responses were analyzed via structural equation modeling using Lisrel.Results and findings: We find that entitativity and perceived authority are related to people's inferences of omission, which consistently drives collective responsibility. However, the effect of inferences of commission on collective responsibility may be affected by the (non)official status of the sponsors. Meanwhile, entitativity and authority are also found to be linked to collective responsibility, which is itself related to sponsee equity.Implications: Theoretically, we advance knowledge of sponsee equity drivers by applying knowledge/theories from social psychology. Managerially, the findings suggest opportunities should be created for sponsors to be entitative and sponsors have an authority over the sponsee."

This raises the question as to whether animosity towards a sponsor’s COO negatively affects sponsorship outcomes, and if so, how it can be addressed. For the latter, we examine holistic sponsor-object fit as well as a set of its constituent elements.Research methods: Data collection pertained to a brand engaged in a hypothetical sponsorship.

Focusing on football fans’ perceptions of value across platforms, this research explores how negative experiences are compensated to recover value.Research methods The study adopts a multi-method triangulation approach, using an online discussion forum and in-depth interviews. The sampling frame consists of football fans (Stage 1 n = 20, Stage 2 n = 20) and participants engaging in fandom activities across a variety of platforms and spheres.Results and findings Perceptions of value among football fans and how it may be disrupted relates to a number of factors, for example, when actors are considered to be ‘locked out’ of physical platforms within joint value co-creation spheres (e.g. stadiums). Fans show that they can compensate to deal with disruptions and recover value for themselves as well as other fan actors on different platforms. Importantly, this study develops an understanding of why fans are not always consistent in their actor role/s.Implications From a sport management perspective, understanding football fandom using this lens is important, as it explains not only how customer-to-customer value co-creation can be facilitated, but also how value recovery can be individually and collectively compensated. Ways in which the level of participation in the football market can be managed are proposed, as well as suggestions for how key factors known to compensate experiences can be differentially communicated across a diversified target audience."

After completing the FSD-T, participants engaged in a self-control task and completed questionnaires that included questions on game playing experiences, FS involvement, covariates, and demographics.Results and findings: The results of Experiment 1 indicated that lowly involved users gain higher energy levels when a goal is framed as non-competitive compared to competitive, while highly involved users gain similar energy levels regardless of the goal-framing. The results of Experiment 2 further demonstrated that trait competitiveness further moderates the effect of FS involvement and different types of goal-framing on a user’s amount of energy.Implications: This study provides unique theoretical insight on the vitalizing effect of drafting players in the fantasy sport context.

These themes are (a) the shift in international relations from a bi-polar to a multi-polar model; (b) the challenging of teleological assumptions concerning the development of western models of modernization, and their replacement with accounts of multiple modernities; (c) the emergence of Populism and the changing nature of political Ideology and sport policy; and (d) contemporary notions of language, truth, discourse.Research methods The paper presents a review of relevant literature in the fields of philosophy, politics, policy and discourse analysis, identifying the impact and significance of such changes.Research findings and implications The findings highlight the need for policy and management to adapt to the new realities. (a) First, operating within a multipolar international relations system implies adaptation to the erosion of western hegemony in the international sports economy. (b) Second, challenge to the dominance of the western modernization thesis, by proponents of multiple modernities, implies a requirement to serve needs of heterogeneous markets within culturally diverse societies. (c) Third, the development of the politics of cultural populism, requires managers/policy-makers to understand and resist the use of sport in promoting negative, non-inclusionary ideological messages. (d) Finally, the undermining of notions of truth in public discourse, will require managers to defend evidence-based policy, and publicly acknowledged criteria of truth in decision-making."

We investigate two types of spectator-to-spectator interaction – between known/familiar others, and between unknown-others. We study their effects within a framework grounded in Customer Dominant Logic and sport value framework, integrating on-pitch sport performance, off-pitch service quality, overall satisfaction, team identification and WOM intention.Research methods: Hypotheses were tested using a survey of 1002 spectators of a British Premier League football club. Respondents were asked about the last game they attended. Data were analysed using Structural Equations Modelling and PROCESS analysis.Results and findings: Customer-to-customer interaction was antecedent to overall satisfaction and team identification. Satisfaction and team identification led to WOM intention, with team identification having greater effect. Evaluation of on-pitch performance (the football match) influenced overall satisfaction more than off-pitch service quality. The study contributes to knowledge in finding that customer-to-customer interaction with familiar accompaniers influenced satisfaction more than interaction with anonymous-other spectators. However, the latter contributed more to team identification and indirectly to WOM.Implications: The study highlights the importance to sports events organisers of facilitating customer-to-customer interaction. While promotion of many sports events focuses on game performance, this study highlights the importance of promoting the social benefits of attendance in increasing positive WOM. Suggestions are made, including provision of social media platforms within events to promote interaction among spectators."

Whilst unique and exciting, this context poses challenges for the management of the sporting experience as there is no control over the outcome of the competition; a disappointing result on-field may translate to a disappointing overall experience for the spectators. We wish to understand if and how quality management practices can be used in off-field operations to mitigate on-field uncertainty, and thus have greater control over spectator perception of the sporting experience.Research methods: A multi-country survey of operations managers of sporting stadia in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand was conducted. We operationalize environmental uncertainty as spectator co-creation and enforced collaboration, and assess quality management orientation from both a customer and process perspective. Linear regression is used for data analysis.Results and Findings: Surprisingly, we find that environmental uncertainty does not encourage the orientation of quality management practices towards the customer. Instead, we find a greater application of process focus. In considering sporting fans as passive customers rather than active co-creators of value, quality management practices seem to have skewed towards process rather than person.Implications: Customer satisfaction appears as secondary to process performance in the sample of stadia examined. This is in contrast to studies that have encouraged a focus on the customer in contexts of environmental uncertainty. We suggest a renewed focus on the customer for the longevity of sporting stadia."

UQR is a novel technique which is as yet underexploited within sport economics and management and confers important methodological advantages over both ordinary least squares and quantile regressions.Results and findings: Significant cross quantile variation is found. High spending football fans spend more, even after ticket prices are excluded.

The Standard revealed a lack of engagement with debates about power relations and equality. Respondents interpreted the Standard through the business and social justice cases. The findings revealed that both approaches are valuable to the Standard's implementation by NGB leaders. More research needs to be undertaken to acknowledge the complexities of implementing equality within the competing pressures on NGBs’ resources.Implications : The equality discourse needs to be reviewed to develop a framework that is more valuable to the NGBs. Three areas of research are recommended: first, to examine the impact of the latest relevant policy The UK Government's Sporting Future (2015); second to develop a workable equity framework that embraces the intersection of power relations with the potential positive impacts of the business case and the social justice case; and third investigate the impact of national equality policies at regional and grassroots levels."

It asks if the field largely neglects sport’s special quality and the study of how managing sport organisations has effects on sport and the sporting human.Research methods: The paper briefly reviews the recent debate of the sport management research field in its three leading journals, but despite being empirical in part, it is foremost a position and conceptual paper. To bring sport back to the centre of the research field, it suggests that sport is conceptualised as a unique institution in an inter-institutional system.Results and findings: In light of the massive increase of research papers published in the leading journals over the past decades, debate of where sport management research is going and whom it serves is scanty. It is likely that this deficiency reflects its immersion in an ideology of managerialism that leaves us unconcerned about the wider influence of our research field.Implications: The paper challenges the research field and its journal editorships to debate where sport management is going, and whom it serves. It encourages discussion that will revitalise and strengthen the discipline and its influence on the practice field of sport management."

It adds to previous research by empirically testing investment in the stock of health on participation-related expenditures.Research methods: Chinese amateur runners (n=6,693) were surveyed on health capital (i.e. health change since taking up running), social capital (i.e. running group participation), consumption capital (i.e. sport profiles), socio-demographics, and running-related expenditures over a one-year period. Two instrumental variables reflecting life domain satisfaction were included to address the endogeneity of health change.Results and findings: Results show that variables capturing health, social, and consumption capital significantly affect total running-related expenditures, whereas the effects on expenditure categories vary. After taking endogeneity into account, the results show that health change since taking up running positively affects total running-related expenditures and sport apparel expenses.Implications: The findings provide empirical support for Downward et al.’s (2009) general economic model of sports consumption by revealing that health, social, and consumption capital are significant drivers of participation-related expenditures. While mass participation, health, and economic objectives may be achieved concurrently, policy makers should carefully balance these objectives. Sport managers and marketers can use mass participant sport events to stimulate continued participation, and this in turn generates health, social, and consumption capital that drives expenditures. Fostering running group participation increases expenditures. Early career runners should be targeted for sport apparel. Cross-promotion among related sports may increase overall sport consumption."

Social media is a cost-efficient way to brand the organization, but a lack of control and consistency indicates a need for brand governance related to social media.Implications: NSOs would benefit from actively involving stakeholders to co-create and strengthen their brand. Social media offers opportunities for branding, but governance regulations should help overcome major challenges. Future research should include interviews with NSOs’ decision-makers to further understand how NSOs can engage more meaningfully with stakeholders and social media to strengthen their brand governance."

Financial data from two further club is also analysed.Results and Findings The results identify two economic models for French esports clubs. These models are mainly based on ‘irrelevant’ revenues, and the French clubs are not profitable due to the rat race in the labor market. Club owners are oriented towards maximizing wins. The regulation mechanisms currently used in the leagues do not seem able to change the teams’ behavior.Implications : The discussion, based on the traditional literature, suggests regulation tools that could guide the behaviors of the clubs to help them to achieve better financial stability and perhaps optimize the competitive balance of the competition. However, more research is needed to define the aims of the regulation of esports leagues."

The league sample is limited to 36 observable leagues out of 55 UEFA member leagues over 2010–2015 due to data paucity.Results and findings: Efficiency scores, checked with several robustness tests, exhibit a scattered efficiency across European football leagues.

However, no research has ever been conducted in relation to team handball. As existing literature mainly focuses on European football and US Major League sports, club managers from smaller sports lack the evidence that could assist them in developing strategies to increase attendance. This study is a step toward filling this gap.Research methods: Using robust panel data regression models deployed on data from Danish men’s team handball league matches in the seasons from 2011/12 to 2015/16, the study identifies the main determinants of spectator demand.Results and findings: The findings are largely consistent with existing research, but also reveal new insights that seem to be specific to handball. These include (1) negative effects on spectator demand due to simultaneous live television coverage of other league matches; (2) no obvious preferences for weekend matches and (3) weather-related factors, whereby rain has a positive effect and snow a negative effect, while variations in temperature have no effect.Implications: To maximize spectator attendance, we suggest that league managers and club representatives take the problem of simultaneous broadcasts from other league matches into consideration when planning the schedule in the future.

Thus, the current study examines the question: what were the associations between hosting the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games, social wellbeing (i.e. sense of belonging), and subjective wellbeing (i.e. life satisfaction) among Canadian youth?Research methods Using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (n > 1,000,000), a time series analysis of youths’ (aged 12–19) reports of perceived sense of belonging to their community and perceived life satisfaction across four time points before and after the Vancouver Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games at the national, provincial, and regional levels was conducted.Research findings The number of youths who reported a strong sense of belonging to their community significantly increased in the host region of North Shore after the Games concluded (2011–2012 to 2013–2014). The number of youths who reported a strong sense of belonging to their community and high life satisfaction significantly increased from 2007–2008 (pre-event) to 2009–2010 in the host region of Richmond.Implications This study provides preliminary evidence that mega-sport events might positively affect wellbeing of youth living in regions that house venues for the event.

Drawing on the intergroup conflict literature, this research derives dual identity statements and examines their effectiveness in reducing fan aggressiveness compared to the managerial practice of downplaying rivalry.Research methods: Three field experimental studies (one face-to-face survey and two online surveys) tested the hypotheses. Established rivalries in the German soccer league Bundesliga served as the empirical setting of the studies. The data were analyzed using ANCOVA and linear regression analyses.Results and findings: Dual identity statements reduce fan aggressiveness compared to both downplay statements and a no-statement control condition, independent of team identification and trait aggression. Importantly, the managerial practice of downplaying rivalry appears to be counterproductive. It produces even higher levels of fan aggressiveness than making no statement, an effect caused by psychological reactance.Implications: Sport organizations should not alienate their fan base by attempting to play down the importance of rivalry, which is an integral part of fan identity. Instead, they should strengthen the supporters’ unique identity (as fans of a particular team) while at the same time facilitating identification with the rival at a superordinate level (e.g. as joint fans of a region)."

It reflects the decisions and behaviour of individual actors and the functioning of organisations and their management bodies. However, within the sport governance literature there is a notable absence of work focusing on trust. This study examines the association of trust and structural features within national governing bodies’ (NGBs) boards.Research methods: 242 board members of 65 NGBs from Germany participated in an online survey which comprised questions on trust indicators and boards’ structural features. Probit models were employed to analyse the association between trust indicators, individual board membership characteristics, and the boards' structural features.Results and findings: Results suggest that trust is a multifaceted phenomenon, affected by various (beneficial and detrimental) variables in the specific context of NGB boards. The study makes numerous interrelation and governance dynamics recognisable, with board size, board members’ skill differentiation and temporal stability of boards appearing to be particularly relevant.Implications: The paper complements the professionalisation literature and the leadership discussion in the context of sport governance, particularly with regard to trust-enhancing working conditions within boards. The study also aligns to the good governance literature, revealing that in some respects the issue may be seen to be about trade-offs between trust-based effects and their resultant (positive or negative) outcomes for organisation, board or individual."

In particular, the process of how the YOG's planned service environment contributes to young athletes’ learning is examined using a transformative service research lens and control value theory.Research methods: An online post-Games survey measured the athletes’ perspective on (1) the service environment; (2) enjoyment; (3) learning; and (4) social outcomes of interest. A total of 330 anonymized responses were collected (boys = 130, girls = 200).Results and findings: All service environment-related factors (i.e. service environment outside of sport, service environment in sport venue, and the Learn and Share program) significantly predicted the social outcomes of interest of the YOG through learning (Mediator1) and enjoyment (Mediator2) both individually and in-sequence.Implications: For the IOC to create greater social outcomes of interest, athletes’ sense of enjoyment and learning must be fostered. Evidence demonstrates that, through athlete enjoyment and learning, the acquisition of social outcomes of interest increases, consequently bolstering the notions advanced in control value theory where positive emotions enhance one's learning. Hence, for the IOC, creating an environment that focuses on the sport competitions as well as on the education and cultural opportunities for athlete exchange is important."

Within and across these components, the analyses reveal three aspects particularly powerful in their potential to shape board composition: degree of formalization, network reliance, and transparency.Implications These findings have implications for research and practice. Regarding the former, the study provides a baseline description that can be used in future explorations of the NC process and its determinants and effects in varying contexts. As for the latter, the findings suggest that sport organizations carry an untapped potential in considering NCs’ shaping potential, regardless of whether an ‘adequate’ board is one that is equipped to improve organizational efficiency or one that safeguards representation and democracy."

An examination of Danish professional soccer's effect on club membership,2020-3-11,21,2,237-256,"Strategy and Management, Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management","ABSTRACTResearch question: The body of literature examining potential trickle-down effects from elite sport success to mass sport participation has grown considerably over the years. The evidence is mixed but generally suggests that when a nation's athletes win medals at international tournaments – for example the Olympic Games or the FIFA World Cup – it cannot be expected to inspire amateurs to take up sport themselves. So far, existing research has primarily focused on international elite success. Effects from local elite clubs playing in national leagues have only been examined once.Research methods: Since recent research indicates that national and cultural contexts can influence whether a potential trickle-down effect materialises, this paper aims to test these factors in another setting. By deploying panel data regression models on data from Danish top-tier professional soccer, we test whether local club performance affects local membership levels in Denmark.Results and Findings: We do not find direct positive effects from sporting success. However, we do identify negative effects on membership figures due to club relegation indicating that sporting failure can affect mass participation.Implications: A key recommendation drawn from this study is that politicians, sport managers and civil servants should be careful using the double pyramid/‘virtuous circle of sport’ metaphor as the basis of their decision-making because it is an imprecise theoretical interpretation of reality. Instead, stakeholders should focus effort and resources on other relevant factors that potentially can lead to higher – or even lower – levels of participation in order to stimulate such factors (or prevent those that affects negatively). Future studies should examine these implications further."

The paper addresses at least two new hypotheses. First, breakaways and episodes of climbing mountain passes increase the audience within a specific stage. Second, the presence of commercials during the broadcasting reduces the audience significantly.Research methods: We have collected information about the minute-by-minute TV audience for all the stages of the 2015 Vuelta a España. To check our hypotheses, we have applied multivariate regression analysis, after controlling for other common variables such as competitive balance or stage profile.Results and findings: Related to our first hypothesis, the TV audience increases when the leader is climbing a mountain, and when a top ten rider is involved in a breakaway. For our second hypothesis, the TV audience decreases when commercials are broadcasted even on a split screen.Implications: This paper highlights the relevance of the analysis of the minute-by-minute TV audience demand in the case of road cycling, at the same time suggesting some hints for enhancing TV audience. On the one hand, organizers may wish to schedule more mountain stages, where breakaways tend to be more likely. On the other hand, TV channels should choose time slots for advertising carefully, since their negative effects on TV audience ratings appear to be quite significant."

The third objective was to statistically verify the identified implications of transparency.Research methods: A mixed research method in equal status concurrent design (qualitative and quantitative) was employed. The data were collected in three phases; a website analysis of 67 Czech NSOs, follow-up interviews, and a survey.Results and findings: A model of transparency was empirically developed based on the quantitative and qualitative analysis.

These findings imply researchers can (1) examine non-profit sport organizations’ changes over time based on a set of archetypes reflecting contemporary realities, and (2) compare and contrast NSOs’ governance more holistically.

Yet, the severity of violations differs between hosts. This study aims to find out whether differences in the severity of violations of human rights issues in potential and actual hosts of the Olympic Games lead to differential consumer evaluations of the Games, and whether Olympic Value perceptions influence evaluations depending on the severity of human rights violations.Research methods Two samples from the U.S. were surveyed. In Study 1, participants were informed about the potential hosting of the Olympic Games in countries outside the U.S. with reportedly high-severity vs. low-severity violations of human rights. Study 2 referred to the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games and framed the U.S. as a country with either high- or low-severity violations of human rights. It also assessed consumer knowledge about human rights issues and country image.Results and findings Attitude toward the Olympic Games was lower in the high (vs. low) severity conditions in both studies. Structural equation modeling results showed that two of the three Olympic value factors predicted consumer attitude in the high (but not in the low) severity conditions, and that attitude as well as some value factors related to intentions to follow the event in both studies.Implications Human rights issues in host countries of Olympic Games have negative effects on consumer evaluations. While consumers might still follow the event, value perceptions are important when violations are severe. This makes ethical concerns salient and affects the Olympic Movement."

Against a background of identified sports and ice hockey masculinities and how they relate to violence norms, the aim of this article is to identify masculinity ideals in need of interventions.Research method: As part of a larger project on masculinity ideals and violence norms in Swedish ice hockey, this case study is based on a thematic analysis of interviews with five Swedish ice hockey coaches. Theoretically, the analysis is inspired by work on hegemonic masculinity and violence prevention.Results and Findings: The findings derived from the interviews are discussed under three thematic headings: ‘The dual functions of sexism and group dynamics’, ‘Aggression and violence as problematic and progressive’ and ‘The stabilising and transformative role of a competitive environment’. In these, core values of the construction of hegemonic masculinity are identified and discussed.Implications: The article contributes knowledge about risk factors in team sports and how attitudes and behaviour in a team or club can be both progressive and destructive at the same time. Based on the study's findings, work on violence prevention and the results of previous research, three preventive actions are suggested: 1. To erase sexist and derogative attitudes and actions so that they do not escalate, 2. Zero tolerance of alcohol consumption and drugs and 3. Change the rules in order to eliminate hard and reckless play."

Based on the concepts of Confucianism and Mencius’ ‘Five Cardinal Relationships’ (Wulun), this article identifies and analyzes how factors of Confucian culture relate to match-fixing in Taiwanese professional baseball (Chinese Professional Baseball League). Research methods: Nine in-depth interviews were conducted with syndicates, baseball coaches, former professional baseball players, and players’ wives. Additionally, data and information were collected from various documentary sources, including court transcripts of Taiwanese match-fixing cases, academic articles, and media and press commentaries. Results and findings: The results show that Wulun concepts can be characterized as a form of Confucianism in which social and familial relations ‘support’ various groups of actors. Elements of Wulun relationships, such as obedience, collective harmony, and loyalty, characterize the specific match-fixing context. Implications: These results indicate that both Confucian ideology and match-fixing are present in the Taiwanese professional baseball system. Meanwhile, Confucian Wulun emerges as a novel analytical concept in the literature on sports corruption."

With previous studies focusing on amateur and non-profit sport organisations (primarily in Canada, Australia and New Zealand), this research answers the call for more research into board roles and in other sport contexts.Research methods: A qualitative design is adopted and 24 directors of Scottish football clubs are interviewed. Football club directors are a difficult to access population and this research represents a rare opportunity to understand the perspectives of key sport governance informants. Template analysis is employed.Results and findings: Findings show that perceived board roles fall into five categories: control, service, operations, resource co-optation and strategy. Organisational size was found to influence perceptions of board roles in Scottish clubs, while an apparent alignment of interests between owners and managers, and a subsequent reduction in agency cost, has implications for the control role. An integration of stewardship theory and resource-dependency theory is argued to provide a more holistic understanding of board roles in this context.Implications: The study responds to calls for a multi-theoretical approach to board roles research by developing an integrative stewardship-resource dependency theory. The integrated theory is argued to be useful in framing the complex dynamics of board roles in Scottish football. Future research is encouraged to assess whether the stewardship-resource dependency theory can provide an effective framework for understanding board roles in other sport settings."

Fans used outgroup derogation, ingroup criticism, social support and humour to cope with the threat.Implications This study was the first to explore a threat to multiple identities of sport fans, which may guide future studies on the interconnected nature of sport identity and other identities. This study revealed that sport identity plays a buffer role on sport entities in undesirable conditions. To minimize the occurrence of multiple identity threats to fans, marketers may need to get more involvement in fans community to know about how their brand is perceived when developing marketing communication."

This perceived imbalance represents a challenge in the online marketing strategies of sports clubs. When club managers decide on the content of online social media posts/messages related to sponsors, they should be aware of potential fan reactions. Therefore, this study analyses how sponsor-related and other online social media communication of football clubs affect fan reactions.Research methods: We analyse Facebook postings (N = 4,603) published by German first division football clubs. After classifying postings regarding their content, we regress ‘Reactions’, ‘Shares’, and ‘Angry’ reactions on the content variable and further covariates. Linear regression models, Poisson regression models, and general dominance statistics are used for exploring variance within the data.Results and Findings: Fans react considerably angrier to sponsor-related posts than to other content except for defeat-related postings. Regarding overall reactions and shares, sponsor-related posts perform worst among different contents. In addition, the content of posts is elementary to negative reactions, but of less importance to overall reaction rates.Implications: Sports managers and sponsors should be aware of the potential negative shift in reactions when using clubs’ social media channels to share sponsor-related content. We recommend releasing sponsor-related posts as videos on game days to decrease the fraction of negative responses and simultaneously maximise the overall reactions."

This study aims to explore how problem sports bettors perceive gambling marketing is affecting them.Research methods: It examines the opinions of 43 sports bettors undergoing treatment for gambling disorder. Seven qualitative focus groups were carried out to understand their self-reported views on gambling marketing influence. Responses were analysed using a thematic analysis approach.Results and findings: The results showed three main marketing paths for impact: (i) mass-mediated marketing stimuli, (ii) personalised marketing, and (iii) stimuli inside betting shops. Price-related promotions (e.g. bonuses) were viewed as especially harmful. Also, the use of cognitive biases by bookmakers made it harder for sports bettors to stop gambling, and constantly facilitated their relapse.Implications: The paper provides evidence to substantiate regulatory action to restrict gambling promotions. In addition, it recommends that gambling companies develop responsible gambling measures to reduce the cognitive biases ingrained in their sports betting products."

This paper seeks to make a contribution to the talent development literature from an organisational perspective. It addresses the following research question: How and at what age have athletes received support services as upcoming talent from their sport clubs and NGBs?Research methods: A total of 2041 elite athletes from 15 nations and 37 different sports were surveyed. Analysis of variance (ANCOVA and MANCOVA) was used to examine the data and identify differences between sports, countries and athletes’ sporting achievement levels.Results and findings: The data revealed that athletes received club or NGB support at a relatively late age. This differed by gender, by sport and between sports in which athletes specialise at younger or older ages. Athletes with higher achievement levels (e.g. in the world’s top eight) were slightly younger when they received support services compared with lower level athletes (e.g. national level); however, effect sizes are small. Most elite athletes received a variety of support services and only slight differences were found according to athletes’ achievement levels.Implications: The relevance of these findings relates to the role that sports clubs (can) play in the total development of an athletic career.

The impact of FFP is estimated by interacting a dummy variable for FFP with the key explanatory variables of each model.Results and findings: Empirical results show that FFP has 1) a negative effect on the relation between wages and sporting results, 2) a positive effect on the relation between net transfer fees and sporting results, and 3) a positive effect on the relation between gains on player trading and financial performance.Implications: Overall results suggest that FFP is altering the business model of Italian clubs from an investment-focused (wage spending) to a more efficiency-driven one that is geared to make gains from player trading. Accordingly, club managers should commit to creating sustainable cycles of player transfers in order to thrive under the new regulatory environment.

An empirical analysis of actual and potential individual investors of professional European football clubs,2019-11-4,20,4,500-519,"Strategy and Management, Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management","ABSTRACTResearch question: Due to the reinforced conditions of official regulatory credit screening procedures of Basel II and Basel III, credit is now more difficult to obtain for risky business models such as sport clubs. Therefore, alternative, supporter-based financial instruments have become more important. The aim of the study is to identify factors that influence the purchase decision of actual and potential individual investors of financial instruments of football clubs.Research methods: We used a standardized online questionnaire to track finance-related, club attachment-related and sociodemographic factors that describe potential or actual European investors in supporter-based financial instruments. In total, 760 respondents completely filled out the questionnaires.Results and findings: Our bivariate and multivariate findings indicate that club attachment is essential for an investment in a football club. The results also underline that traditional investment objectives are more or less irrelevant for supporter-involved financial instruments.Implications: Investors expect an emotional return that compensates their financial efforts. Therefore, football clubs can act differentially in comparison to other firms issuing financial instruments such as stocks and bonds. The individual investors of football club-related financial instruments do not expect or require a financial return of the issuing football club."

Some interviewees were members of the organisation in question, while others represent various partner organisations. Supplementary data was added in the form of various written sources (e.g. annual reports).Results and Findings: The social entrepreneurial sports organisation's networks encompass many actors from all societal sectors, and the networks themselves may assume many forms (e.g. social, institutional and reputational), as may the character of the cooperation involved. The study shows that several of the networks are characterised not only by a common desire to attain a win-win situation but also by mutual dependency. Through its use of networks, the organisation has reduced its dependence on financial support, a dependency which otherwise tends to burden social entrepreneurial organisations. Thus, the networks enable the organisation to continuously develop its social ambition to improve people's social values through participation in a wide range of sporting and outdoor activities.Implications: This study contributes to a broader understanding of the significance of networks. The results indicate that it is necessary to consider other network types than solely social networks. Besides this, practitioners can transfer a number of the networks described to their own organisations. Consequently, the study constitutes a potential source of inspiration for sports organisations."

Against this background the main research question is whether there are systematic differences in competitive balance between the genders among the bigger sports leagues.Research methods: The analysis involves football (soccer), handball and basketball leagues for the period 2007/08–2016/17 (14 leagues and 135 observations) and is based on quantitative methods. Competitive balance is a multidimensional concept, and this paper separately measures win dispersion, performance persistence and prize (here: championship winner) concentration.Results and findings: In football (soccer), win dispersion is strongly significantly weaker for women’s leagues compared to their respective men’s leagues, while the results for the other dimensions are mixed. Generally, the level of competitive balance seems weak in women’s football (soccer) and in handball. For the latter, there is little difference in competitive balance between the genders. In basketball, the strong significant results for performance persistence suggest that the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) is more balanced than the NBA.Implications: The level of competitive balance in women’s football in Europe looks weak, also compared to the women’s football in North America. If this leads to competitive balance problems (i.e. lower attendance, ceteris paribus) among women’s football in Europe, governing bodies should consider traditional regulations to promote equalization of sporting quality and/or to adjust the framework of the game to better fit women’s physiques."

Whilst the short-term impacts of the 2010 FIFA World Cup™ in South Africa have been largely considered to be positive, there is little evidence of longer term outcomes. This paper contributes to the sport mega-event legacy literature by presenting empirical evidence of the longer term developmental legacy using a case study of a community-focused sports project. Key factors underpinning sustainable legacy outcomes are identified.Research methods: The Football Foundation of South Africa (FFSA) was selected as a case study due to the novel ways in which the project developed. Thirty-eight interviews were conducted with stakeholders involved directly in the FFSA’s day-to-day delivery and management, people from organisations who deliver sport and recreation services at the local and regional levels and children who use the facility. The interviews were recorded and transcribed, and the data were analysed using qualitative content analysis approach.Results and findings: The FFSA is achieving substantial and increasing reach into local, especially disadvantaged, communities. Children expressed very strong positive feelings about the contribution it makes to their lives. Several factors have enabled the FFSA to be successful, with the most critical being the strong institutional context within which the project is embedded involving local, regional, national and global organisations.Implications: The success of the FFSA highlights gaps in mega-event legacy planning. International sport bodies should develop formal mechanisms for drawing their corporate stakeholders together with community-based groups to identify and deliver sustainable developmental programmes."

Balancing economic interests with social concerns through a service-thinking approach,2019-10-22,21,1,1-19,"Strategy and Management, Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management","ABSTRACTResearch question: The aim of this study is to conceptualize sports markets in a way which enables us to (1) explore how the economic and social aspects of markets might be (re)aligned; (2) discuss practical solutions for how this might be achieved; and (3) identify what the implications are for management practice.Research methods: Literature from developments in contemporary marketing and market studies are combined to discuss the difference between interested and concerned markets. Service thinking is used ontologically and analytically to illustrate how sports organizations might reconcile the tensions and realities of existence in a business environment, and act positively within both interested and concerned market spaces.Research findings: The study suggests that sports organizations must consider the type and configuration of resource; network capabilities; and core organizational values to balance economic interests and social concerns. Secondly, practitioners should consider their organizations as a collective of co-existing entities: (1) teams; (2) clubs and (3) brands. Each organizational form has implications for the resources, capabilities and outcomes achievable by adopting service thinking.Implications: The paper provides an alternative way of thinking about sports markets, and provides a conceptual space for scholars to consider future research into the dimensions of market concern and how these shape business practice. Generic examples are presented of sports business practice that may also be useful for actors in other service industries."

In Phase 3, a confirmatory factor analysis and a structural equation modeling analysis using online survey data (N = 483) were conducted to validate the proposed PDSI scale and test the influence of PDSI on consumer behavior.Results and findings: A PDSI measurement scale was developed and validated, resulting in 19 desired self-images under three dimensions: inner self-merit, lifestyle pursuance, and social self-presentation. Findings of the structural relationship model revealed that PDSI influenced personal involvement, money expenditure, and time expenditure.Implications: This study preliminarily unearthed salient items in PDSI, highlighted the symbolic nature of sport activities, and demonstrated the importance of PSDI in sport participation. These findings provided implications for practitioners to accommodate PDSI through long-term and integrated marketing efforts and shed a light on studies in branding, community sport, and public health."

This paper aims to estimate the partial RAE on the market value of top-level European football players with a new methodology.Research methods We analysed a data set of players from the biggest five European football leagues over ten seasons (2008-2017). We argue that the conventional estimation of RAE fails to yield a partial effect, due to a sample selection bias. For various regression models, we use a stratified sampling method to balance the birth date distribution and eliminate the bias.Results and Findings Unlike prior studies, we found an extremely strong straight RAE in elite European football, especially for younger players.

The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of service-related actions provided by a professional sport team on relationship quality (RQ). The current study is aimed at answering two research questions: (1) ‘what are antecedents of RQ?’ and (2) ‘how do the composition and quality of services provided by sports organisations impact customer perceptions of the quality of their relationship?’Research methods Over 3300 season ticket holders (STH) of a professional Australian Football team were surveyed. The predictive ability of the antecedents and RQ was examined by testing the direct relationship between RQ and STH behavioural intentions, including intentions of remaining a STH and referral intention.Results and findings Four key service and performance-related antecedents (service quality, communication, administration and on-field performance) had a positive influence on RQ. RQ was a significant predictor of intentions to remain a STH and referral intention.Implications This study contributes to sport management literature by highlighting the importance of developing high-quality relationships. Areas team management can directly control, such as good administration and communications efforts, improve perceptions of the relationship between STH and team, providing a potential buffer against unpredictable on-field outcomes that are a feature of professional sport. Our findings should encourage sport managers to use strategic service-related actions within their operations to positively influence the deep and long-lasting relationships between STH and a sports team."

Thus far, utilitarian and neoclassical economic thinking has dominated sport management scholarship; however, here it is asked: should scholars now be thinking in terms of a new geopolitical economy of sport?Research methods This is a commentary paper based upon pieces of literature drawn from sport management, geography, politics and economics.Results and findings The submission contends that scholarly activity in sport needs to be reoriented towards a new perspective – the geopolitical economy of sport. Whilst not dismissing the relevance of existing utilitarian or neoclassical perspectives, it is argued in this study that how scholars conventionally view sport must change to maintain the relevance of their research and scholarship.Implications In addition to exploring the implications of conceiving sport as a geopolitical economy, the following five areas are identified in which there are significant implications (hence further research is needed): Sport as an outcome of geography;Sport as a focus for soft power, diplomacy and trade;Sport as a networked geopolitically economic activity;Sport as the basis for achieving national competitive advantage;Sport as a means of acquiring resources."

However, recent research indicates that sport fandom escalates or de-escalates over time with calls to examine the intersection of parenting and sport fandom. This research focuses on mothers and fathers and examines how their sport fandom intensifies or declines as a consequence of having and raising children. This research will add to our understanding of fandom by identifying when and under what circumstances sport fandom is a bonding or detaching experience for parents and the role it plays in socialization and consumer behavior.Research methods: The study adopts a multi-method interpretive qualitative approach, using in-depth interviews and an online discussion forum. The sampling frame consists of a total of 35 parents using two stages of research (Stage 1 n = 15, Stage 2 n = 20). Participants are at varying stages of parenthood with single and mixed gender families.Results and findings: The study develops a typology of (de)escalating sport fandom during parenthood and differentiates between fandom as pertaining to an individual or social identity. Data also reveal varying dichotomies, such as excess and moderation, risk and reward, individual and shared behaviors (including customer-to-customer interaction) as well as perceptions of allegiance and disloyalty.Implications: Knowledge of parenting and sport fandom will assist managers in developing effective loyalty schemes and marketing packages and will offer an understanding of the temporal effect of having children on fandom."

We examine whether FFP’s break-even rule has increased the profitability of football clubs.Research methods : We use data from the top five European football leagues (those of England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) over the period 2008–2016. Our sample includes 1,094 club-year observations (139 different clubs). Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and profit before tax (PBT) margins are used as profitability measures. The impact of FFP is estimated using the Generalized Estimation Equations (GEE), logistic regressions, and fixed effects OLS models. We control for both domestic and European competition success, leverage, club size, and country/club fixed effects.Results and Findings In the pre-FFP period, roughly 70 percent of observations are losses, whereas in the post-FFP period, roughly 60 percent of observations are losses. However, the estimated positive effect is significant only in Spain, while for England and Germany we find weak evidence. We cannot rule out that the observed improvement in performance is simply caused by the recovery from the financial crisis. The effect of FFP is insignificant in France and Italy.Implications The effect of FFP on clubs’ profitability has been at best modest.

It extends previous research by distinguishing between different participation purposes and investigating travel distances for each purpose.Research methods: Survey data on the travel behavior of sport participants in 21 sports in Germany were collected (n = 7060). Participation frequency and the number of kilometers traveled for different purposes, including training sessions, competitions or tournaments, league games, day trips, and sport vacations or training camps, were assessed for a one-year period. The empirical analysis takes endogeneity into account by using a set of instrumental variables for the five participation frequency and travel distance variables.Results and findings: Ordinary least squares regression results show a significant negative relationship between traveling to training sessions and subjective well-being, while the association of sport vacations/training camps is positive and significant. The instrumental variable models reveal significant positive effects for traveling to training sessions and day trips.Implications: The findings support the importance of considering the causality of effects. The notion of the unhappy commuter found in existing travel research is not supported for traveling to regular training sessions. Traveling for the purpose of competitive sports (tournaments, league games) does not yield significant well-being outcomes, suggesting that participation in various forms of sport competitions generates stress for participants."

The splintering of the online fan community into these micro-communities represents a form of cyberbalkanization and has implications for female fans’ ability to build bridging social capital on social media.Implications : This study responds to calls for a more theoretically informed approach to social media research in sport, drawing on theories of social capital and performative sport fandom to understand the strategies employed by female fans in performing their fandom on social media. The findings raise questions of how professional sports clubs can engage female audiences and champion inclusive cultures of fandom."

In doing so, the study responds to calls for further, empirical research on both the experiences of female sports fans and the darker side of social media.Research methods : An exploratory, qualitative research design is adopted, comprising in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 15 female fans of European professional football clubs. Interview data is analysed using inductive thematic analysis.Results and findings : The study contributes novel evidence to the fields of social media, social capital and football fandom, revealing that the male hegemony of football fandom is reinforced through social media.

Sport apparel is operationalized as a categorical, hierarchical variable. Given the censored nature of the dependent variable, a two step Heckman-type approach with an interval regression model was used. Data were obtained from a cross-sectional sample of adults in Flanders, Belgium (N=1355). The results indicate that the decision to spend money on sport clothing and shoes is mainly determined by sport-related lifestyle characteristics, confirming the emerging importance of lifestyle in understanding the decision to consume material goods. However, the variability in the amount of money spent on sport apparel is explained by both socio-demographic variables and sport-related lifestyle characteristics. Consequently, both socio-demographic and lifestyle variables are used in the interval regression models, which is introduced as a novel technique to create consumer profiles. These profiles assist sporting goods marketers in refining their strategies to reach specific target markets. "
